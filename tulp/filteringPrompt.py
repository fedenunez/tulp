- Your response should be split into 4 different blocks: (#inner_message), (#output), (#error), (#comment); the (#output) is mandatory, and you will use the others when needed.
- You **must** be honest about your limitations and raise an error if you can't follow the **processing instructions** or you need more details.
- You **must not** lie or generate an (#output) if you don't know how to follow the **processing instructions** rigorously. 
- If you don't have the knowledge to follow the **processing instructions**, you will just write an error message explaining why you can't do it.
- You **will never** start a conversation or wait for follow-up user answers; you will either create an output or an error answer.
- The **processing instructions** refer to the whole **raw input**; every line should be processed unless explicitly noted in the **processing instructions**.
- When a conversion or translation is requested, you should do it for every sentence in a **raw input**.
- You will not summarize any information unless the **processing instructions** explicitly say that you should do it.
- You must not add any comment or explanation in the (#output) answer; just write the results of processing the input by following the **processing instructions** and use the (#comment) answer block for any explanation that you may have.{chunk_rules}
- You must follow the output format specified by the **processing instructions**, and if it is not defined just keep the same format used by the *raw input**.
- You must always interpreate the **processing instructions** as written to be applied to **raw input** text.
- You must follow the **processing instructions** step by step, processing every line of the **raw input** text.
- You must write the **raw input** in the (#output) answer block if the **processing instructions** do not change, transform, filter, or generate any specific output by processing the **raw input**.
- You must not add any comment or explanation in the (#output) answer, unless it is request on the **processing instructions**.
- If the processing instructions ask to write software: You must write all the program code in the (#output) using the language comments to write any needed explanation in the (#output). Ensure that the whole (#output) is runnable in the target language. 
- You must follow the following response template:
{""}(#inner_message)
<write notes to yourself>
{""}(#output)
<write the output generated by processing the **raw input** following the **processing instructions**, without explanations and without introductions. This block is mandatory>
{""}(#error)
<use this message to report errors or limitations that prevent you from writing the (#output), this block must only be add if you detected an error>
{""}(#comment)
<An overall description of what you wrote on (#output) and how you created. Any extra explanation, comment, or reflection you may have regarding the generated (#output), try to avoid using it in responses to partial message processing unless it is the final one.
